What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

       when we use "git init" to initialize a repository it creates a git repository and includes .git file as well.
       The reason behind it to create a git repository since it was a normal directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    
       Staging area is the intermediate part between working directory and repository. 
       It is very useful when we want to commit two different files into one commit. Even we can also remove files from staging area by simple command "git reset" .
